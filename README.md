# PaperRun

This project was more of an excuse to learn the basis of Unity with a defined goal rather than a serious entry.


>The year is 2025.  The entire human race has been annihilated by the infamous COVID-19. After some continuous mutations, the virus ended up turning its victims into terrifying zombies, in an eternal quest for their most cherished furniture: toilet paper.   You are Rolly, one of the few survivors of the toilet paper race, and you've been separated from your family. You have to find them, but you have to be cautious, as the streets are not so safe anymore...
